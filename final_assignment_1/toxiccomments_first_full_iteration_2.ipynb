      "I think that a clear need exists for the division between balanced and unbalanced transmission lines. Many aerials are balanced such as the centre fed half wave dipole, these aerials can be fed using a balanced line which is connected directly to the some old equipment or via a balun in the shack. The other option is to use a balun near the feed point of the aerial and an unbalanced feeder (This arrangement normally leads to higher losses, but it is more EMC friendly). While the use of long runs of balanced feeder is something which many people outside of the radio community are unaware of, it is a concept which is very important and WP will be better if such things are included.\n",

The article as it stands pretends that this split does not exist, which is exactly the position of the Chinese government.  That's merely the beginning of the POV slanting here.  In terms of literature specifically, the article waves its hand vaguely at many centuries of Tibetan literature, then focuses heavily on a contemporary literary organization established by the Chinese government.  Even the literary cliques identified use standard Chinese naming \"\"the 4 blanks\"\", \"\"the 3 blanks.\"\"\n",

Words in 'scare quotes' should not be used in headings, since they raise the question of who is using the term.  Comparing the text with a summary provided by the CSM, I find a few apparent inaccuracies in the text.  The IRS did not flag the 75 groups for review of their tax-exempt status.  Instead they flagged new applications for tax-exempt status for new Tea Party groups formed in the run-up to the 2012 election.  Groups whose main activity is support of political candidates and parties are ineligible for tax-exempt status.  The CSM does not say that asking for donor lists is a \"\"violation of IRS policy\"\", just that it is not typically required.  I do not see either the need to quote so many people.  Just citing Republican and Tea Party sources makes it appear that they are the only ones who hold that opinion.  Why not just summarize the general reaction to the story - that the IRS has abused its power by failing to be \"\"nonpolitical, nonpartisan and neutral.\"\"    \"\n",

Almost all his edits(which have been consistently poised against the Tamil people in general need to be reviewed, and he needs to explain on what overall value he has added to wikipedia in his edits, except for adding/removing sensitive information that fulfills his whims) So perhaps, involvement of more editors to the issue will see through his low-down motives with which he edits, and the barbaric means he resorts to when he gets desperate. So I guess we let him do his course of job, as there is sadly not much room to deal with his uncivil and inflammatory behavior.  (talk . contr . mail) \"\n",

On the one hand I had to save the life of Mr. Gandhi; on the other, I had to protect the legitimate rights of millions of my fellow untouchable brothers with the full value of my life. I had never thought that this double perplexing situation will be resolved so easily and successfully. I am very happy that all the Hindu leaders showed a great understanding and took a totally thoughtful and cooperative stance in the moment of this terrible and responsible situation so that we could arrive at a satisfactory solution to come out of this very complex situation. This could be possible only due to the struggle and vehement efforts made by Mahatma Gandhi for it. I was very surprised when Mahatma Gandhi accepted and gave assent to all my demands and even congratulated me. If he had adopted the same stand in the Second Round Table Conference, this difficult situation wouldn't have arisen. I am very happy to give acceptance and assent to this successful pact. If my Upper Caste brothers wholeheartedly accept and try to implement this pact, then I and my untouchable brothers would be very happy. On this occasion I do not hesitate to give credit to Sir Tejbahadur Sapru and C. Rajgopalachari besides Mahatma Gandhi for the success of this Pact.\"\" (Source: http://buddhambedkar.blogspot.com/2011/07/poona-pact-and-its-agreement.html)\n",

I know that his title was King of the Romans but I think it is common WP pratice to use the term \"\"King of Germany\"\" for that respective office to avoid confusion. Also, to say that there was no Germany at that time is wrong - there was a German Kingdom that was part (in fact the primary part of the Holy Roman Empire. And Albert was King of that Kingdom. I hope you understand.  (smile back) \n",

I think it's possible to create links without necessarily making page titles—and there really are some atrocious ones about ('Ladislas the Posthumous' being one of them, in my opinion)—appear on the page in question. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is certainly possible and reasonable to call Albert \"\"King of the Germans\"\" or \"\"German King\"\" (the Germans themselves use the term \"\"Römisch-deutscher König\"\", which covers it nicely. But even here on English Wikipedia, where there are many mistakes in this matter, the term \"\"King of Germany\"\" is rarely used. Of course there was a Germany at that time in the sense of a German-speaking volk,  but there was not a German kingdom in the sense of a political state ruled by a royal government (when a later King of the Romans, Ferdinand I, tried to administer Hungary and Bohemia from Vienna, he was rebuffed— and he wouldn't have even tried that much in principalities where he was not the dynastic prince, such as Saxony or Brandenburg); the nearest thing to a German kindom, the Carolingian kingdom of the East Franks (even that has been called the Kingdom of Germany only as a back-formation), had fragmented fairly quickly into a group of states with their own princes (in the case of Bohemia, an actual king). Albert II is an interesting case because in his purely German-speaking territories he was only a duke. His kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, though part of the Holy Roman Empire, were largely non-German, which is another reason why Rex Romanorum is correct and not \"\"King of Germany\"\".\n",

In my opinion, having had this stuff drummed into me at university, where I had to read texts in Latin and German, that doesn't so much clarify as blur the issue. The title \"\"King of the Romans\"\" may be difficult, and so may the idea of a group of independent German (and non-German) states within the Holy Roman Empire, but the readers of Wikipedia, in my opinion, shouldn't have history revised for them to make it fit the modern world (and Austria still isn't the same country as Germany anyway).

I don't know if you're Wikignoming because you lack the time or resources to expand articles or if it's just something you prefer to do, but there's certainly other stuff that you can be profitably be doing. Ship article titles need to have the ship's name in italics or you could focus on improving their categorization, neither of which I tend to remember to do anything about. Adding convert templates to articles is certainly worthwhile, although I'd suggest you limit your preference for always abbreviating everything. For one thing, I like to show the hyphen form of a compound adjective like 15-inch gun, something that abbreviating eliminates. You could ensure that articles written in AmEnglish use American spelling of units and vice versa; just be sure not to change the type of English unless there are strong national connections like RN ships use BritEng or USN ships use AmEng. Articles on non-English speaking navies' ships have no national connection and can be written in either form; just be sure that it's consistent within the article. And if you'd like to write a ship article, I'd be happy to help as I have a pretty large library; so much so that I don't really consider Jane's Fighting Ships as a top tier resource.

So remove the part that sainis claim to be Rajputs. Sainis are Yaduvanshis. When Yadu vansh started there was no such caste as Rajput. Read the puranas and other history sources. So there is no such thing as sainis claiming to be Rajputs. Sainis are Yaduvanshis and there is no such thing that sainis claim to be Yaduvanshi, it is a fact that sainis are Yaduvanshis. Sainis were warriors. Also in sikhism, sainis played a very important role in the areas of Anandpur sahib and Chamkaur sahib, fought for Guru Gobind Singh ji. In holy text, Guru Garanth sahib ji, Saini caste is mentioned as the true friends or sajjan or mitar. So Sitush stop creating your own stories.

This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere.

These four options in Islamic law concerning POWs are well-known amongst academics and scholars, as my sources have proven. So my edits have not been making any large structural changes to the article, I have concentrated on one sub-section and have elaborated on these four facts.

On July 19, you made this allegation that I have not discussed my edits to the POW section. The truth is that I started discussing the POW section 10 days ago, on July 10, when I started the section Talk:Jihad#Heraclius.27_Mass_Reversion_War. The issue was subsequently discussed in three lengthy sections of this discussion page, before you made this allegation.

Neutrality does not mean that if some traditional belief disagrees with the values of modern Western society then it must be not be mentioned. You seem to be advocating ahistorical apologetics over neutral and objective facts. You have not disproven any of my claims about POWs and Islam, but you have insisted that these objective facts are somehow \"\"dangerous.\"\" As for your allegations of \"\"wholesale demonization,\"\" they are unwarrented. The way that Islam treats prisoners of war is completely in line with the norms of the medieval era, during which these practicies were codified. It is a fact of life that Islamic beliefs are deeply rooted in the past, and as a result they are sometimes in disagreement with modern, secular humanist values. If you were truly neutral about this subject, then you would not object to the reporting of facts just because the demonstrate a disagreement between traditional Islam and modern, secular humanist values.

As for the snapping sound, using common sense, yet, again, a tiny canary's neck snapping could, and probably does, sound like a human's fingers snapping; you expect some loud CRACK with onomatopoeia on the screen? Besides the \"\"finger snapping\"\" theory, which, being the only real theory that could contest the accepted one, can't possibly hold up, without assuming the unverifiable idea that 47 uber-trained his bird, there is no other way you can explain the bird being silenced that isn't totally outlandish and basically unbelievable. Also, if you try to use the \"\"I'm following the rules\"\" clause, taking into account that Wikipedia isn't a beaucracy and that the sheer existence of this conversation is ridiculous, the statement that says 47 kills his bird should stay.

      "I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all \"\"Eichmann's.\"\" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)\"\n",

If your argument was to be taken that - every event of Baburam's life has to be put in and then only this point about 'issuance of warrant' against him is to be put in then, you and everyone needs to do this on each and every article of Wikipedia.

The contributions show that this is a Truther with detailed knowledge of Wikipedia policy and editing procedures, and is very obviously not a new user.

I.e. something like \"\"Luther's Small Catechism, the Catechism Bach taught to students at the Thomasschule\"\" (assuming it was Thomasschule, as I have no idea) instead of a simple link. Also, Christian symbolism in Bach's works is certainly an interesting topic, and it is already mentioned in the \"\"Style\"\" section. Perhaps one day someone will feel bold enough to create something like Musical style of Johann Sebastian Bach, and then we'd have enough space to elaborate on this aspect of Bach's work.

Also its true that the modern Bulgarians are nothing turkic, as they are white europeans. Aren't Bulgarians white? Then what race are they? Croats are our closest relatives and they are proven by scientists. Also in many Bulgarian historical books it states clearly that the Bulgarians are closely related to the Hungarians and Croats as they were all part of one tribe in Eastern Europe. To include middle eastern as part of the Bulgarian genetic section is horrendous as it has nothing to do with the Bulgarian people. Mediterranean only partly. There are other evidence that states that Bulgaria has a stronger slavic influence like the Croats and the Slovenes, however there are some sources that claim they are separated from the tight slavic cluster together with the southern croats, serbs, macedonians and romanians. Both different sources should be respected but to include a middle eastern section is beyond belief, its a lie and totally ridiculous. Bulgarians are a mixture of slavic, alpine, dinaric, mediterranean, nordic and pontid. Pontids and the north pontids are about 50% of the population and they are a mix of atlanto mediterranean heritage and nordic people.\n",

CIA MKULTRA ran San Fransisco clubs prior to the hippy movement which emerged from that town, where patrons were 'spiked' with LSD. Ken Kesey learnt about LSD through his involvement in CIA MKULTRA experiments. He was a core figure in the burgeoning hippy movement. LSD did not leak into the 'youth culture' merely from medical sources, CIA had bought the majority of the world's supply of LSD, and this was a source and influence to the 'youth culture' movement just as important as Tim Leary. Even if you believe that the CIA kept its LSD well regulated, the internal CIA culture is not seperate from the US general culture to the degree you would purport to support your 'skepticism'. The experiences that the CIA officers and experimental subjects were having with LSD is just as legitimate an influence on culture as any other individuals experiences. 'Culture' includes and intermixes influences from everyone, CIA are not exempt, as much as some would like to pretend they are. \"\"We are all in this together,\"\" this \"\"lifeboat earth,\"\" this \"\"floating island in space\"\".

At least as the anon editor presents it, the Barsamian interview is used in relation to Churchill's own ethnicity. The GAA section is about scholarly disagreements on the meaning of the Act. Moreover, while we have a quote in the GAA where Churchill affirms his belief, this quote is more specific in describing Churchill's interpretation. Maybe we should add a note like \"\"see also below section\"\" to make the connection. Btw. your lead to the discussion of Churchill's attitude about his ethnicity is much better than the anon wrote, thanks for that.

      "Here are my thoughts in detail....  I agree with Kamosuke that China is similar to the Roman Empire, with respect to culture, politics, literature, arts, and religion, as well as its influence towards its surrounding nations.  More specifically, Luoyang (洛陽) and Chang'an (長安) are similar to Ancient Rome.  However, you cannot eliminate the mention of Korea.  From the dawn of historically recorded Japan, until the fall of Baekje, Korean influence was greater than Chinese influence.  Then there follows a period in Japan where Korean immigrant families remain important while Japan looks to China for influence; but eventually these families assimilate and dissolve into Japan.  A period of greater Chinese influence continues for at least 9 centuries.  However after Japan is discovered by Europe, Japan chooses a policy of sakoku for 200 years, where all foreign trade is conducted through Nagasaki.  Western influence is maintined through Rangaku studies and direct contact with Westerners at Nagasaki.  Meiji Restoration opens the door further to Western influence.\n",

      "\n",
      "The referenced literature presents the Nursing Model of Peplau is based on an interpersonal theory structured on the nurse-client relationship development. Peplau created the Psychological tasks as a learning process which nurses could help their patients achieve personal maturity, since their illnesses have been caused by breaks or failed development during this process. The four Psychological tasks are learning to control others, learning to delay satisfaction, identifying oneself, and developing skills in participation. These stages are classified by age, childhood, following concepts developed by Freud and Sullivan. There are some important understandings about Peplau’s nursing model: Nursing is a human relationship, Psychodynamic nursing is a tool to oneself and other-selves development, and Rules are social establishments important to keep functional the social structure. As an example of nursing rules Peplau define social actors as a stranger, resource person, counselor, teacher, leader, technical expert and surrogate. These actors have an important function to improve the relationship between nurse and patient. The nursing-client relationship is oriented by four phases, Orientation, Identification, Exploitation and Resolution. The Peplau’s model provides the nurse as a facilitator of the process of the client development, where the professional - armed with the rules and techniques – interacts through relationship with the client to achieve a missed learning and maturing process.\n",

If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.   \n",
      "As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically \"\"no consensus at all\"\".  Cheers.   \n",
      "Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.   \n",
      "The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines \"\"Christian terrorism\"\" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term \"\"Christian religious terrorism\"\" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression \"\"Christian terrorism\"\" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about \"\"religious communal terrorism\"\" carried out by Christians, or \"\"nationalist terrorism\"\" between different religious groups.\n",

But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of \"\"Christian terrorism\"\" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word \"\"genocide\"\" instead of the word \"\"terrorism\"\". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link.

The few free energy machines still having their own wikipedia page are full of rant how crackpots try to destroy the laws of thermodynamics and how nutterish they are, not your usual trolling but the work of experts. Take the introduction of the Water fuel cell. \"\"the source of this addition energy has not been scientifically identified therefore the theory is treated with skepticism.\"\" There was barely any theory, it just worked! And it has not been investigated. The way it's treated is not worthy of being in the description. An encyclopedia should not instruct it's readers behaviour? Tell me how to treat things huh? \"\"such a practice conforms to the parameters of perpetual motion, hence conclusive scientific investigation would either verify violation of thermodynamic law or identify the source of claimed additional energy.\"\" But if there isn't going to be any scientific analysis - ever! then the laws of thermodynamics are nonsense. If the best scientists can do is preach the laws then it's just not very likely they are right about the topic. Then it says: \"\"At least one car prototype, reportedly powered by a water fuel cell, has been assembled.\"\" HUH what? but but but??

What kind of person would do that with a known to work invention? And why was this important information deleted? Then it says: Stanley Meyer was granted patents in the United States and abroad starting in 1989. The verifiability, and scientific basis, of the patents are controversial. Now I know the water motor patents where granted after a working model was displayed. You can see it in the application number. There is no other way to get a patent on an electrolysis cell. Because of those laws of thermodynamics you know? You do know about those right? You can see free energy suppression live at work when you see that the world famous American inventor Stanley Meyer was not worthy of his own wikipedia page. It's obvious he cant have a page because that would violate conservation of energy right? Paul Pantone does have his own page where again the working of his device is denied by no-witness, The GEET page however describes a Hindi film? BTW Paul was also scammed by his investors? ha-ha? Yull Brown is also not worthy of his own page? Makes it kind of hard to write about free energy suppression when the suppressed and murdered inventors are not allowed the light of day? What about William A. Rhodes? Dennis klein then? no? Isaac de Rivaz? Daniel Dingle? etc etc?? At least we still have the Oxyhydrogen page right? haha? This is how free energy suppression is done.

      "\n",
      "The way its proponents describe it. Since this for them is largely a matter of posturing and semantics - because their own people are completely unaffected by the results of the measure - their interest in the subject pretty much ends with the passage of the measure. They can say marriage is only \"\"x\"\" because their own people are prohibited from ever expressing something other than \"\"x,\"\" the demonstrated behavior of Ted Haggard and many if not most of their own people notwithstanding. It for them is largely a demonstration of power and status, of ostensibly being able to call the shots by social and political means, by calling for purification of society as they in their fantasies imagine it should be, no matter whose bodies happen to be in the way. (Gives a whole new meaning to the Pentecostal chant/song about \"\"under my feet.\"\")\n",
      "\n",
      "The way the people who will have to deal with the aftermath of the measure's passage describe it. Since the Attorney General has to enforce the law once passed, the Attorney General titled the measure so that what happens after the election is quite clear: certain people's rights that existed before the election were eliminated. Since the people proposing the measure aren't ever going to be in that class, or so they believe, they don't care about this, or even care enough to allow the suggestion to pass  that the lives of people will be affected. That goes for editors here who are proponents of the measure, who are fighting against any measure of Proposition 8 in a way that might actually hint that individual people are going to be affected by having their rights eliminated. (Yeah, they don't care about people outside their churches except as potential converts, as notches on their bedposts, to be manipulated at will, against their consent, unless and until they get their butt in church. They call this \"\"love,\"\" of course, in case you were wondering what they think that word means.)\n",

      "After two months of having to restore the ballot title \"\"eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry\"\" to the Proposition 8 article in the runup to the election, and having sat through one of the satellite simulcasts promoting the measure, clearly this is how its proponents think. They seem to live in a people-free universe, that nobody will be affected by it, and demand that any description of the measure that actually mentions people's rights must be scrubbed. That is what certain editors want to continue doing here. Justifying this scrubbing and elimination of the mention of real-world consequences of the measure is not \"\"NPOV.\"\" It's attempted scrubbing of dissenting views, to which I object in the strongest possible terms. As for COI, your insinuation that anyone objecting to Prop 8 here is a directly-affected, by the common standards of the proponents' evangelical community, dirty diseased queer whose edits must be blocked or questioned on the basis of a COI just shows exactly where your prejudices lie.   \n",

The naming of the sweet cannot straightforwardly choose as Rasgulla. However, the naming in Wikipedia appears to be followed only the Oxford dictionaries, as an anglicize name loaned from a foreign country. But the name obviously misspelled there, as the dictionary mentions rasgullā originates in Hindi – so the name to be disambiguated to avoid confusion with Rosogolla for the reasons many reliable English-language sources mentions the sweet name Rosogolla, The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets describes Rosogolla is primarily associated with West Bengal, then Bengal in British India. The fact establishes the origin of the sweet is in Bengal - a part of greater India, not Hindi, in Bengal the sweet is called Rosogolla since its initial usage.  \n",

Whereas, considering the deleted article Rosogolla's naturalness, consistency, prevalence in many reliable English-language sources, as well as its usage around 250 million Bengali people in Bangladesh, West Bengal, other states in India and world over, the name Rosogolla has come into majority use. The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets highlights Rosogolla, and describes often-spelled Rasgulla, it is a very new edition published in the United Kingdom and the US. The name Rosogolla has been preferred in several publications in United Kingdom and the US. Some of these books are (1) Milk - Beyond the Dairy: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food... by Harlan Walke, Page 58. (2) Strategic Management: Formulation, Implementation and Control, by PEARCE, Page 179. (3) Food Culture in India, by Colleen Taylor Sen. There are too many reliable English sources in United Kingdom and the US those mention the sweet as Rosogolla. A confusing entry in the Oxford dictionaries cannot really overlook Rosogolla’s merit as a title name from the reliable English-language sources.\n",

If it goes 2-1 in favor of Myanmar what is to stop another person from calling another mediation where it could go 2-1 in favor of Burma? Unless there are side by side articles of an identical nature I can't see this ending anytime soon. Even then there will be mediation requests to merge the articles. And writing more pros and cons is certainly a waste of time since it's already written down on the last mediation page. Either a new mediator will impanel a new jury, read what was already written and make a new judgement or a mediator will look at what has gone on before and say to himself \"\"this was already done and I can't do any better.\"\" Just my observations.   \"\n",

I'm looking over the EFFECTS section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol USE. It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (This is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). Nevertheless, I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article.

At the time a close variant of this statement was first inserted into the article, there was an then ongoing discussion relating to the inclusion of the Time Magazine cover image involving WP technical minutiae relating to WP:NFC. In my opinion and that of other participants, it was a reasonable editorial discretionary decision to include it, though the precise formulation plainly is questionable and subject to debate in particular about the second and third question presented. That question reads: \"\"If so, does the evidence support it and related explanations of the history of life on Earth?\"\" It's followed by the assertion that \"\"if the answer to either question is negative\"\" then the third question follows. IMO, this, although reasonable, is just edItorial opinion. The paragraph with the three questions was just very recently flagged for citation, which according to a strict reading of WP:V allows for its removal, at least lacking a consensus override of its removal. After initially resisting, I support its removal. ..... The section flows rationally and informatively, and in keeping with WP's core content policies, either with or without that paragraph. ...   \"\n",

      "R is the series resistance component in the equivalent circuit model of a non-ideal transmission line, and G is the shunt conductance in the same model.  Physically, the R and the G arise due to completely different reasons:  R is due to the small, yet finite, resistivity in the non-ideal metal conductor(s) of the line, whereas G is due to the small, yet again finite, conductivity of the non-ideal dielectric material between the metal conductor(s) of the line.  Therefore, in a lossless transmission line, where the metal is a perfect conductor and the dielectric is a perfect insulator, the metal exhibits no resistivity and the dielectric exhibits no conductivity.  Hence, the characteristic impedance of the lossless line reduces to Z0 = sqrt(L/C).\n",

On the other hand a \"\"lossless,\"\" i.e., perfect transmission line will cause no loss of signal energy.\n",

I was wondering if you could put in context your own level of knowledge in chemistry, so that the articles can be reeditted to be applicable to your own level of knowledge. With the chemical reaction stubs, I have been assuming that people will generally be looking at them  if they have a basic level of chemical knowledge (i.e. one of about an A-Level student in England) and will not need a full explanation of why the reaction proceeds as it does. If this does not fulfil your ideals what else will I need to add, complete mechanisms with comments of facial and stereo selectivities and such. If so this is simply not possible as there will be a large amount of repeated information on Wikipedia. Please get back to me on this topic. - \n",

The first point to make is that the only remaining delete view was made before the article was improved and still refers to its former state. The keepers asserted that the sources met WP:N. No-one in the discussion argued against that assertion. The fact that coverage is from a regional newspaper in no way invalidates it for the purposes of WP:N. Also, notability is an absolute standard - there is no requirement that any member of a class of articles (no pun intended) is distinctive from other members of that class.

      "In regards to your question about adding more pictures, one of the main concerns of editors on the MJ page is that the pictures are cluttering up the text and making it more difficult to read. I would have to agree with this concern: as nice as pictures are, wikipedia is about information and this is conveyed through text and to-the-point pictures. I think that putting pictures documenting the change in Michael's appearance would draw undue attention to that facet of his life. Sure, a few pictures are good, but these show him in some important light, whether in a record-breaking video, or on the cover of one of his record-breaking albums, or during a popular performance. That leads me on to your other query, about using images from live, recent events. The only problem there is that, IMO, the picture quality decreases and that brings recentism to the article. Basically, it's focussing too much on the present, whereas wikipedia is meant to equally document MJ's entire life. Finally, regards the 80s picture, I was actually against it a while back, and tried to replace it with a then-recent picture of his acceptance of a 'Legend Award' in Japan. I didn't manage this successfully, but then I realized that the current picture is probably the best one to be there. It is the perfect representation of MJ, in the prime of his career, epitomizing the success that he was, and IMO still is. To put a 2007 picture would bring recentism to the article, and most editors don't like that. Anyway, I hope that I've answered some of the queries you have. If you need to know anything else just contact me on my talk page. Thanks.\n",

The result is that there are contingents of what I call \"\"Wiki-addicts\"\" who make little positive contribution to the encyclopedia, but who make a lot of trouble for other editors.  They generally call themselves \"\"skeptics\"\", and they spend hours each day attacking articles they don't like.  They fancy themselves to be guardians of neutrality, but their edits are rarely neutral.  They also fancy themselves to be Wikipedia experts, and consequently they are rarely willing to collaborate.  Generally, they are atheists, right-wing Christians and political conservatives, and they attack articles on topics that are not in the mainstream, especially in the area of religion.  The Seth Material article has suffered from such attacks since it was created a couple years ago.  Recently, several \"\"skeptics\"\" ganged up on me and got me kicked off the article.  The editors who are now in control of it have no knowledge of the Seth Material whatsoever, beyond the fact that they don't like it, so the article is now controlled by editors who would prefer to delete the article altogether.  They have already cut out portions of it.  If you want to see the most complete version of the article, look for the version edited by \"\"Itsmejudith\"\".  You'll find text in there that has since been deleted.\n",

      "Basically, my message to you is that Wikipedia is a hostile environment, especially if you are interested in topics of religion or spirituality.  If you have things to say in those areas, it is best to do it on your own web site.  With so many editors on Wikipedia intent on censoring information they don't like, it is very hard to make contributions in those areas without getting into non-stop edit-wars.  \"\n",

      "Xeno, if I have violated WP:POINT, is that a bigger offense than being rude and offensive? I dont understand how someone can be blocked for making a point, but not for saying things like \"\"what are you fucking on about\"\" and all the other kinds of comments I gathered here. Isnt something wrong here? What is wrong is, I'll just say it: Jimbo's tolerance for rude and aggresive behavior. That may change if I get a reply from him but the fact that comments like the ones I gathered above, are being allowed to be said, without any punishment or enforcement of discipline and that, people are ok with, is a serious problem here. My \"\"violating\"\" comment was to show that rude offensive comments are wrong and should be enforced. Thats exactly what I have proved. Did I violate WP:POINT? Actually I explicitly mentioned in my post that I was indeed trying to \"\"deliver a point\"\" (to quote myself). The point was to show Bali that he did not like what I said because the way I said it. The problem is that such behavior is not being enforced. It is OK if I was blocked for my comment, if that was the only thing I said. The admin did the right thing. However what should have happened is that Bali should have been blocked (say even 12 hours is fine, a week would be excessive) in the first place and that did not happen. What is sad that we all couldnt even agree that rude and offensive behavior is punishable. Even George came and complained about Bali's rudeness but nothing was done and the issue was closed. As far as the enforcement of being respectful to other editors is concerned, I think its a sad state of affairs. I will be talking about the problem of rudeness at Wikipedia with more people here and outside Wikipedia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taelus, the reason for the unblock is simple: I (obviously) did not mean what I said. I only said it to demonstrate that no one likes to be talked to in a rude, aggressive manner like Bali did (\"\"what are you fucking on about\"\"). Basically its absurd that I've been blocked for making a \"\"demo\"\" post of rudeness while other editors go unpunished in real situations. In summary, my unblock reason is: \"\"I was kidding and trying to show an example.\"\" Also as I mentioned to Xeno above, is making a POINT violation a more serious offense than being rude and aggressive?

There is a template (Template:Cite video) that can be used to cite a video available though a URL but, obviously, you'd have to be sure that the URL steers clear of Wikipedia:Copyright violations. Personally, I would suggest not to use the film as a source for this sort of thing because secondary sources are always better, if available. Also, you want to avoid violating WP:SYNTH which is done when you present a conclusion that you reached yourself by citing a primary source. But, if you do decide to cite the film as a source, you can use reference #68 from this version of Children of Men as a guide of how to format a citation to the actual film.  (talk • contribs) \"\n",

      " I think this is all rather scholastic. The name is admittedly imperfect due to the fact that the article essentially catalogues very recent (by the standards of any encyclopedia) and ongoing events. But the term could be justified: the number 2 therein implies a clear reference to THE Cold War, which evokes unmistakable associations, the prime one being the rivalry exactly between Russia (the USSR) and the US for the global dominance (to put it bluntly). And not just some highly localised and geopolitically irrelevant (unless you watch CNN claptrap on a daily basis) squabble somewhere in the Near East. Russia is the only state that not merely defies the US, but challenges the entire status quo as established post-Cold War, as is clear from Putin's quotes cited in the Background section. There is every sign that he is determined to achieve at least what the USSR had, i.e. dominance over half of the Continental Europe, or to go nuclear in a very literal sense of the term, i.e. obliterating the centres of Western civilisation. This is almost official now. Thus, at the end of the day, Yes, it is about the US vs the RF, as the US is the only military force in NATO to speak of. But the implications thereof are very broad, the phenomenon is nascent, therefore separate article is warranted, I think. We do not know as of now how it is to evolve: it may very well be the case, the appropriate title in a few months will be \"\"THE RUN-UP TO WORLD WAR III\"\".  \"\n",

      "BritishWatcher: Thanks for your courteous and transparent question (the first I have seen from the UK clique since I got \"\"involved\"\").  I'll address your second point.  If my answer to that is not clear, there is little point taking the time to suggest actual changes.  Your clarifying question mentions the premise that each part of the UK has its own subdivisions.  The article states this, but your phrasing implies that the parts are not themselves subdivisions.  The article says nothing about that.  Besides the lack of clarity on that point (assuming your reading is correct), there is another confusion in the article: I think the majority of the people reading this article will understand that the four countries are the focus of the article and that the title of the article (Subdivisions...) refers to them.  If it is the case that the parts are not themselves subdivisions, then the article is far from clear on this point (except to the three or four who have been \"\"involved\"\").  Hence, there are two confusions in the article: 1) the title suggests that the parts are subdivisions (because of the structure and general content of the article) and 2) since the article explicitly divides the UK into the four countries, this suggests that the parts are themselves subdivisions.  Your reading suggests that the title of the article should be \"\"subdivisions of the four parts of UK\"\", not \"\"subdivisions of the UK\"\".  Until these confusions are addresses, I think the article casts more shadow than light on the subject.   \"\n",

If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity. Religious science, scientific religion, esoteric cosmology, religious cosmology, what? Perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts? You know if we wrote that The Urantia Book is an epochal revelation containing religio-scientific cosmology... there would then start more POV debating.  00:34, 16\n",

Its members are taught its precepts by a series of ritual dramas, which folow ancient forms and use stonemasons' customs and tools as allegorical guides.

      "The traditional view of the origins of Freemasonry is that it descended in a direct line from a presumed governing body of operative stonemasons. There is, however, no firm evidence to support this view. In England, no organisation of operative or working masons survived The Reformation, and there are only a few instances of non-working masons being admitted to masonic lodges during the 17th century - probably with the aim of creating meeting places for those who sought to promote religious and political tolerance in an intolerant age. Honorary members were also admitted to operative masonic lodges in Scotland, but there is no evidence that such lodges employed ceremonies of initiation or engaged in philosophical discussion.\n",

      "Truly Speculative Masonry can be certainly dated only to 1717, when four lodges in London united to form a Grand Lodge as a governing body of English Freemasonry.

      "The text even states that Northern Morocco was a Spanish colony! if you read the article on Morocco, the situation was much more complex, it states \"\"Successful Portuguese efforts to invade and control the Atlantic coast in the fifteenth century did not profoundly affect the Mediterranean heart of Morocco. After the Napoleonic Wars, Egypt and the North African maghreb became increasingly ungovernable from Istanbul, the resort of pirates under local beys, and as Europe industrialized, an increasingly prized potential for colonization. The Maghreb had far greater proven wealth than the unknown rest of Africa and a location of strategic importance affecting the exit from the Mediterranean. For the first time, Morocco became a state of some interest in itself to the European Powers. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830. Recognition by the United Kingdom in 1904 of France's sphere of influence in Morocco provoked a German reaction; the crisis of June 1905 was resolved at the Algeciras Conference, Spain in 1906, which formalized France's \"\"special position\"\" and entrusted policing of Morocco to France and Spain jointly. A second Moroccan crisis provoked by Berlin, increased tensions between European powers. The Treaty of Fez (signed on March 30, 1912) made Morocco a protectorate of France. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones on November 27 that year.\"\"! \"\n",

With the ancient people, there really would be no way to prove the lineage unless one was to unearth many ancient graves, examine and carbon date the remains, compare the DNA of the different graves, and then come up with a comparative analisys of the ancient peoples' DNA to that of the modern-day people. With the latter day arrivals of conquerors it is possible that they may have had some influence as well for at first a lot of the anscestors of the modern-day Arabs, Kurds, Mongols, Persians, and Turks were originally Christian and/or converts, and the area they ruled remained predominantly Christian with Syriac as the lingua franca up until the Islamic conquests. Many may have been assimilated into the Syriac Christian culture. The ancient Assyrian empire had a policy of deporting inhabitants from their natural environments and relocating them to urban areas of the empire in order to assimilate them into Assyro-Babylonian culture, which in turn caused a loss, or to the least of that extent, a merger of cultures, in turn somewhat destroying their own sense of national identity. That tactic was borrowed and applied by the Persians, and by many empires that followed, including the United States, with its former policy against Native Americans of relocating them to Reservations. Ironically, this has been the fate of the modern-day people. The Ba'ath parties of Iraq, Syria, and to a lesser extent, Syria's influence and interference in Lebanese affairs, were adament in replacing all ethnic identities with an Arab Nationalistic identity.\n",

Just because some one writes books and they are used as sources in articles is not a good way to determine primary use.  I'd argue that the 59 references used to write the Mary Miller (actress) implies a much more notable person and better makes the case then another article that is based on only a single reference.  I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.  Obviously this means that the current page needs to be disambiguated to Mary Miller (art historian) to allow the dab page to be moved.  Using the statistics provided in opposition to this proposal clearly shows that, if anything, the current article does not even receive a majority of the hits.  So while that is not a good way of proving primary use, in this case it makes a strong case that there is no obvious primary use so the dab page should be moved.

If we created an article incorporating the World Islamic Front (WIF) with the larger organization created by the WIF through their Jihad Against Zionists and Crusaders fatwa, it would incorrectly identify members of the larger organization as being strictly Islamic. Nowhere in the Jihad Against Zionists and Crusaders fatwa, does the WIF limit the membership of the organization to Muslim. In his video and audio addresses, bin Ladin often refers to the International Front for Jihad against the Zionists and Crusaders (IFJZC) as a multi-cultural organization or movement concerned primarily with doing what is right for all people by objecting to the special interests of Zionists and Crusaders. He regularly appeals to Americans to join the IFJZC to fight \"\"tyranny and suppression of freedom to [our] own country, ...the Patriot Act under the disguise of fighting terrorism.\"\"  \"\n",

That's when a secondary source comes in. A secondary source's author is \"\"one step removed\"\" from the event reducing the chance of bias, and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion, evaluation, and/or conclusion. Furthermore, secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. It helps us avoid original research. One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions, whether intentionally or not, which would be considered original research.

I'd like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research, but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering \"\"what's that?\"\" can browse with relative ease. As such, I feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content (most of which is only relevant to medical professionals) on specific pages, and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points. Let me know what you think about this approach, and please modify my submissions or revert them as you see fit. \n",

      "In the case of the Trouton-Noble experiment, all the interactions involved are electromagnetic interactions. So once a theoretician has granted that in the physics of electromagnetism the Lorentz transformations apply, things can be taken from there.\n",
      "Now, of course, Lorentz had to assume that a planet that is moving through the lorentzian ether is flattened in the direction of motion, just as everything else. That is a modification of how the force of gravity is transmitted.\n",
      "\n",
      " Coulomb force couples to electric charge, what does gravity couple to? \n",
      " \n",
      "But does the force of gravity couple to the rest mass, or to the total mass? If gravity couples only to the rest mass then the ether theory stands a chance of reproducing the prediction of the Einstein interpretation, as the rest mass is invariant under Lorentz transformation. But as far as we know gravitation involves the total mass. This is an illustration of the fact that in relativistic physics gravitation just bursts out of the confines of special relativity. Something has to give. \n",
      "This theme is similar, I think, to the theme in John Nortons paper about Nordström's Lorentz invariant scalar theory of gravitation; gravitation just bursts out of special relativity, and a successor to special relativity is needed. (And was provided by Einstein.) \n",
      "\n",
      "Poincaré's 1905 Palermo paper (facsimile reproduction, non-digital, 3 MB file) has a considerable section about gravitation. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Poincaré demands gravitational-inertial mass equivalence as a constraint on the theory. I think that if Poincaré had anticipated that light is deflected by gravitation, he would have written so. \n",
      "I think it was well after 1905 that recognition came that light does not only carry momentum, it also carries inertial mass. When light propagates from an emitter to a receiver, it not only transmits momentum, it also transmits inertial mass. The inertial mass of the emitter decreases on emission of the light, and the inertial mass of the receiver increases on absorption. Of course, light has zero rest mass. Since light has zero rest mass, the natural assumption is that light is not affected by gravity. \n",
      "Possibly, considerations of this nature made Poincaré very, very cautious towards attributing inertial mass to energy. \n",
      "\n",
      "In his 1909 Göttingen lecture, Poincaré went very far in attributing the increased inertia of a fast-moving electron to increased energy of the ether surrounding the electron, in response to the high velocity of the electrons. Can that still work for muons and tauon's? My understanding is that electrons and muons are identical as far as electric charge and spin are concerned, but that they are different in rest mass. Should electrons and muons become more and more alike at higher velocities? To my knowledge: at all velocities the energy of muons is the muon's rest mass multiplied with the relativistic factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am indeed very curious how Lorentz dealt with these issues. As you indicate: historians of science describe that Lorentz retained a preference for using a lorentzian interpretation, but from the lectures Lorentz gave in the 1920ties it can be seen that Lorentz had full mathematical mastery of special and general relativity.  | Talk\n",

We have to decide which one has contributed more to Dragon Ball becoming known in the English-speaking world. In my opinion, it was the manga, since Dragon Ball has been known for a very long time thanks to it, and, in the US, the first broadcasts of the anime where unsuccessful while the manga was already a success, and I have the impression that it was this success with the manga that lead Funimation to keep on trying.

      " @  You stated: \"\"Users do not get blocked for content disputes;\"\" FYI: They do: WP:3RR You stated on the Bitcoin Talk Page: \"\"Users do not get blocked for content disputes;\"\" FYI:They do: WP:3RRThe three-revert rule[edit]Shortcut:WP:3RREditors who engage in edit warring are liable to be BLOCKED from editing to prevent further disruption. While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.The three-revert rule states:An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.A \"\"page\"\" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A \"\"revert\"\" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.\n",
      "If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.\"\"  \"\n",

Ironically, this issue was addressed in another section above, with one of the editors concluding that the fame of Clinton alone would not suffice to make the comparison noteworthy. Another editor (or perhaps it was the same) then suggested that it might be noteworthy if it involved some sort of legal analysis. The parties seemed to agree but then - inexplicably - left it in without explaining how Clinton's comparison amounts to a legal analysis. Exactly how does Clinton's statement that the case would go down in history as one of the worst SCOTUS cases along with Dred Scott amount to any sort of legal analysis? With all due respect, I would argue that this is nothing but a conclusory assertion unsupported by any sound legal reasoning and should not be included in the article. If others want to leave it in, fine, but they should realize that this will open up the flood gates for including virtually any other opinion of a famous person regardless of how unsubstantiated it may be.

He does this by inflating the casualty figures listed. He has used several methods to do this. Firstly, by changing the numbers given by sourced material, thereby falsifying it. Secondly, by inventing sources and or/citing them falsely. He refuses to engage with other users when asked detailed questions about this behaviour, but instead makes personal attacks (specifically calling users loyalist paramilitary supporters) and threatens to get other editors banned from wikipedia. This behaviour has been going on for nearly a year now and is hugely disruptive to the articles in question. This is not only due to the factual inaccuracies and POV he inserts, but also because his reverts delete all the work done on the articles since his previous edits. Additionally, his constant reverts have had the effect of re-posting copyrgiht material that had been removed. Finally, Devin79 has also defamed a living person, Irish journalist Henry McDonald, although he has not engaged in revert wars there when his edits were removed. Jdorney \n",

So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5].

If I see an incorrect comma in the third paragraph, a spelling error in the fifth, an incorrect link in the sixth, an incorrect date in the eighth, and unclear wording in the thirteenth, does Wikipedia prefer that I do one big edit so that it will have only one new page to store, or is it okay to save as I go along?

Ann, firstly, diskspace is so incredibly cheap that you could type flat out for your whole life and you wouldn't fill a drive that cost 100 euros;  so don't worry about diskspace.  This issue of what to do in an individual edit is one purely for the convenience of other people who are reading it.  So if you're doing a bunch of fairly trivial tweaks (fixing grammar, spelling, formatting, etc) then do all of those in one go (and give an edit summary like \"\"various grammar and spelling tweaks\"\".  If the article needs tweaks and also need a higher-level change (adding or removing a big chunk of text, fixing some wording that you thing is seriously incorrect or misreading) then do the trivial fixes in one edit, and the other fix in another (with an edit summary like \"\"removing nonsense about Father Dougal\"\").

If the articles said he was a careless driver who got off work one night and then crashed his car into a truck carrying tissue samples to another lab for analysis, thereby making that person's death a total mystery, then your point would be valid.  An accident that Dr. Kade might have caused when he wasn't on the timeclock tells us nothing about his competence while he was on the clock.  We know he was on the clock when he put an innocent man in jail for five months. We know he was on the timeclock when he screwed up another case that was unrelated to that unfortunate man.  Therefore his screwy actions while he was working are relevant to yet another mysterious death that he was supposed to solve but didn't (Kupcinet). At least he didn't solve it to the satisfaction of those gossip queens known as sheriffs.  If they didn't cut open her dead body, then they knew nothing, right?  The woman's father didn't see the autopsy, either, and he actually was considered a gossiper by some people, so to hell with him, too.  Right ?\n",

Nixon did, in fact, make a brief comment about Kennedy-Monroe when he was interviewed for 60 Minutes in 1984, ten years after he resigned.  Video and audio of it exist, but I, for one, never will add it to Wikipedia.  If I did, Wildhartlivie would want a footnote citation that identifies the producer of the segment and what he ate for breakfast on the day it aired.  Someone else would remove it on the basis that as long as it had nothing to do with China, anything Nixon said about others' flaws was a lie.

I added it again, then specifically referenced the blog post (from the official site) with a youtube video which had the the band confirming their new single. Status again undid my changes stating \"\"tumblr, really?\"\" which I know tumblr isn't a reliable source, however if he cared to actually click the link and read and watch the youtube link, he would have seen it was an official tumblr account and youtube account.

Using a sockpuppet or changing to a different account to escape unwanted criticism is permitted at Wikipedia.  If his actions had been limited to that, I would not have responded to Tommstein's request at all as an ill-founded request.  However, what led me to respond were two factors: one, that Retcon had fraudulently attempted to mislead people into believing he and Missionary were different people, and two, that he created at least one impersonation account, impersonating a person who he was clearly at odds with.\n",

Personal attacks (such as  calling Retcon a \"\"compulsive liar\"\") are neither helpful nor welcomed.

      "\n",
      "Generally, a certain risk of local tissue damage is involved when using local anesthetics often and regularly during a longer period at a specific location of your body. For example, the chronic use of topical eye anesthetics in chronic eye pain would almost certainly and relatively quickly lead to serious eye damage (corneal damage).\n",
      "Before using local anesthetics, chronic local pain should not only carefully be assessed with medical specialists for the local problem (for example an ophtalmologist, dermatologist, dentist or a neurologist/specialist for peripheral nerve blocks), but also by specialists for centrally active pain medication.\n",
      " Medical specialists (ophtalmologists, dermatologists, dentists or neurologists for peripheral nerve blocks) for the local problem can assess how big the risk of chronically using local anesthetics at that particular location is.\n",
      " In most cases of chronic pain, it is not the peripheral nervous system but the central nervous system that is not able to cope with the pain impulses coming from the location in the peripheral nervous system where the damage that causes the pain is actually located. Therefore, medical specialists for the central nervous system (usually a neurologist or pain specialist) can assess if and what kind of centrally acting medication can or should be taken. Very often, it is less harmful and risky to use centrally active substances (especially when they are only taken in low doses) against chronic pain in the peripheral nerve system than chronically using local anesthetics at a particular location of the body. Relatively risk free, especially when taken in small doses, and at the same time often effective against chronic peripheral pain are antidepressants of the SSRI class and the stronger tricyclic antidepressants like for example amitriptyline. Furthermore, modern anticonvulsants like pregabalin or gabapentin are relatively risk free and at the same time relatively effective against chronic pain, at least when taken in very low or low doses. One of the strongest and more risky options in the reduction of peripheral pain are anticonvulsants like carbamazepine. On the other hand, some other classes of centrally acting substances like for example opioids (they are unfortunately still often used in the treatment of chronic pain, including local pain in the peripheral nerve system) are extremely harmful and should be avoided in the treatment of chronic pain at all costs.\n",

Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now \"\"deleted\"\" comment. Especially the section on the \"\"Dutch media controversy\"\" is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If User:Slrubenstein does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians.

The opening paragraph includes the following sentence: The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies.  Could you check the source cited for this sentence because I think the sentence contains an error?  It states that the number of Vans' aircraft \"\"produced each year in North America exceeds ... \"\" and compares it with \"\"all commercial general aviation companies.\"\"  Vans' aircraft are manufactured in large numbers by amateur builders all around the world, not just in the USA and Canada, so the large number of such aircraft produced annually shouldn't be confined to North America.  Secondly, if you are talking about \"\"all commercial general aviation companies\"\" you are including such companies world-wide.  The number of aircraft produced by the world's general aviation companies is unlikely to be known with any accuracy because, outside North America, Europe and other English-speaking countries, aircraft manufacturers don't report their production statistices to anyone, and are not obliged to do so.

To justify inclusion presumed accuracy and verifiability are necessary, but not sufficient. The condom thing is a pretty ignominious basis for calling him an inventor, groupie stuff in short, but since it is marketed and patented, and possibly effective for all I know, go ahead; some readers might enjoy a snigger.

I see, I did something I shouldn't have done, and I'll remember not to react like that ever again. Offense is realized and I will never do something like that again. To floquenbeam, If I am now in one of your blackbooks and I've now irritated you to the point where you can't stand me, I'll stay away from you and I'll mind my own business. I agree such a thing between me and Dave has escalated as of 2012, but I feel that it is wrong for blocking me for 'personal attacks' because I haven't made any hurl of vulgarity of any kind, I only violated an interaction ban that's it.  I see what I didn't wasn't clever. If this block proposal passes and if I'm unblocked, I promise not to do it again, and I will agree never to come near Dave1185's path ever again. I tried to do the right thing, but it didn't as we are all on the learning curve. }}\n",

      "  is correct as regards changing one's name.  As per the reference he supplied, in the Republic of Ireland, all that is necessary is that one begins using the new name, and that it not be done for fraudulent purposes.  Doing so is extremely common - how many thousands of women, for example, take their husband's surname on marriage without getting their name changed by deed poll?  Changing one's name in this way is an entirely different thing from having one's Registration of Birth amended, where specific statutes apply.  From the GRO's website: \"\"Changes to the Register of Births are almost impossible to effect and generally are only done if it can be proved that a clerical or factual error was made at the time of registration.\"\"  So one can change one's name in common usage from, e.g., George to Jack, but George would remain on the Register of Births, unless you also changed it by deed poll.  My understanding on the case of the transsexual who wanted to have her birth registration amended was that she wanted the gender changed (though I'm open to correction on this).  As an aside - I queried Eamon O Cuiv's use of the letter 'V' in his surname on his article's talk page, and someone pointed out he conveniently drops the 'O' from 'O Cuiv' for listing on ballot papers...  \"\n",

Adding an analytical comment to an article about a film is fine if it's from a review you cite by Roger Ebert. Adding such a comment when the observation comes from the editor who adds it is not. Some editors point to the primary material in which the narrative is found, but the primary sources (such as an issue of Amazing Spider-Man) only contains the narrative itself; it does not contain any analysis of it. Material is not quoted or paraphrased directly from a source, but which constitutes an analysis or observation derived from it is called synthesis, which is a form of original research. The bottom line the need to ask, Who is the person making the observation? If it's the editor, it's simply not permitted.\n",

The guitar sound is almost always distorted and amplified, creating what has been called a \"\"buzzsaw\"\" sound.[26] Hardcore bassists use varied rhythms in their basslines, ranging from longer held notes (whole notes and half notes) to quarter notes, to rapid eighth note or sixteenth note runs. To play rapid bass lines that would be hard to play with the fingers, some bassists use a pick.[25] Some bassists emphasize a very technical style of bass playing. Some hardcore punk drummers play fast D beat one moment and then drop tempo into elaborate musical breakdowns the next. Drummers typically play eighth notes on the cymbals, because at the tempos used in hardcore it would be difficult to play a smaller subdivision of the beat.[25] ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC. 73.193.195.69  \"\n",

      "Relating to  (and let me be honest, I'm not up for a protracted debate, I'm just here to offer a perspective that you are free to ignore).  The problem is how you phrased the issue.  If you are claiming admin abuse, you need to be specific.  If you are claiming it is no longer needed, then your opinion of PBS's original ban is irrelevant.  When it comes to General Sanctions, admin are given broad and sweeping authority, because the community wanted them to have a hammer to deal with problems.  Whether you deserved it or not, I have no idea, I didn't do that research and don't have time.  I'm talking about procedure here.  Kosh's comments just muddied the waters, unquestionably admin have the authority to do moratoriums and the like on these articles under General Sanctions, and do topic bans.  Authority isn't debatable because it is clearly spelled out in policy, so Kosh ended up making it less likely others would participate when debating something that is clearly not debatable, and PBS was on topic in addressing those points.  Your points got lost in the mix.  It happens.  And Dougweller and RGloucester also piped in, it wasn't just one person.  It was just one person taking your side, but he was mistaken on the procedural points.  Even DGG jumped in to support the moratorium, and he isn't prone to jump into fires.  Then Obsidi joined the fray.  So 5 people participated, besides yourself, not just one. The problem being that you guys debated the right of the admin to impose sanctions (and he clearly has the right), instead of the circumstances of your situation, which is why 80% of the people disagreed with you and Kosh. You complain that only one admin has spoken, but that isn't true.  Obviously, PBS is an admin, but so is Dougweller and DGG, neither of which has a reputation for being heavy handed.  Quite the opposite, actually.  In reality, he could have put a one year moratorium on name changes and it would have been 100% supported in policy, but he chose a very short and reasonable period.  You might not LIKE it, but the community voted specifically to give admin that power.  If you had not muddied the discussion up by mixing both issues, your topic ban and his authority to issue a moratorium, you would have had a better chance, although odds are that the topic ban would have stuck because there wasn't any abuse in his doing so that I could see.  It was his judgement.  Disagreeing with it doesn't make it abuse. And the fact that it was only three months....that is the shortest topic ban I've ever seen, so obviously he wasn't trying to be heavy handed.  Sometimes, you just have to accept that you don't have a case, and this one could easily be closed as \"\"no consensus to make any changes to existing sanctions\"\".  Again, I'm not up for debating, but I could care less about these articles, and if you want an honest review from an experienced admin, you just read it.  - 2¢ \"\n",

I have tried doing EBSCO host searches and have looked for titles in my university library (the largest library in my state, mind you), and I have been unable to find a single title that is exclusively about Hillsdale College.  I suspect the reason is that, while it was once a radical college, it has become more conservative as the world has changed.  It was expected to become more radical, in the way that Antioch College did; but it didn't.  I think that the best solution is for outsiders to acknowledge Hillsdale's impressive history while still writing about it from an objective point-of-view.  If there are other people willing to write about the school, there will be less need to visit the \"\"Imprimis\"\" website to compose a wikipedia article on the subject.\n",

The Cathedral of Learning seems to be a pretty big landmark, and certainly can be included; including CMU as well would seem to represent Pittsburgh's status as an educational city. Maybe put those two as the images at the bottom? For the other two images, maybe either Heinz Field or PNC Park (but not both, as too many sports pictures would be overkill; but we could put, for example, PNC Park in the infobox and then a picture of Heinz Field in the Sports section).

      "\":::Wait, where am I saying that there isn't a \"\"centralized regime\"\"? ...? (And yes, Castille and Aragon etc were independent from each other) As you know in those times this monarchy was called \"\"Spanish\"\" as it had the same meaning as Hispanic or Iberian. But using the name (note this is just a name problem) \"\"Spanish Empire\"\" today, when we have a different concept of \"\"Spain\"\", causes confusion (the most positive effect that can happen). That's why there are now words like Iberian Union, that didn't exist at that time, but historians created them for some reason, and that's why the names Denmark-Norway and Kalmar Union exist too. Again, this is a name problem because the meaning of \"\"Spain\"\" today changed (although I say again the castillian and the portuguese empires were never together). That's why this article will not be stable (locked icon hello?), but OK, if you want keep it as it is now, I can shut up, I have much to do, all I said was wrong, this is an awful OR and I was wrong in the encyclopedia (I do not want this to be used as an argument after this, let's use just historical arguments in the discussion).

GVnayR is a very \"\"dangerous\"\" Wikipedian, I can deepen it. I'm editing Wikipedia since 2010 and I can say that he is the lamest, weirdest, most \"\"dangerous\"\", etc. In my opinion being blocked indefinitely because of this is not fair (1~2 months is more fair). Sadly, blocking this user Hydao (who always fought against vandalism and addition of nonsense things) will not solve the problem. Sooner, the user GVnayR will start adding completely stupid and nonsense things on Wikipedia, which is unacceptable. I will continue fighting against vandalism and nonsense stuff (added by losers/nolifers like GVnayR), with or without \"\"Hydao\"\". Now you are thinking: \"\"Hydao, you are insulting a user by calling \"\"loser and no-lifer\"\", but that's not an insult, it's just the reality. A high-functioning autistic who doesn't work, doesn't have a job, doesn't have friends, use the government pension to buy PlayStation games and pay the Internet bill, someone who spend his days/months/years doing NOTHING useful (except making frequently STUPID edits on Wikipedia and wasting other ppl PRECIOUS time...) is a big loser who needs a LIFE LESSON. I don't mind if this \"\"Hydao\"\" is blocked, the only thing I know is that GVnayR needs an \"\"ULTIMATE LESSON\"\".

      "The thing is that Saying that the Vedas permit beef-eating and cow-slaughter amounts to striking a lethal blow to a Hindu’s soul. Respect for bovine or livestock animals is a core tenet of Hinduism. But, Once you are able to convince a hindu of flaws in the foundation of this core tenet and make him feel stupid/guilty, '''he becomes an easy prey for the predator faiths. There are millions of ill-informed Hindus who are not empowered to counter argue and hence quietly surrender (and convert).Vegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism. The Vedas are also accused of animal sacrifice in sacrificial ceremonies popularly known as the YAJNA. Interestingly a section of home-bred intellectuals claiming to have deep study of ancient India has also come up, who cite references from works of western indologists to vindicate such untrue accusation against the Vedas.The Vedas have not condoned the practice of killing animals anywhere,.

The ridiculous misquote about 'communists invading Missouri with chemical weapons' was a result of that discussion.

If they don't get the short-track, their plan is essentially dead, which is why they'll show a tiny bit of leeway in the short term to get what they want in the long term. What's most notable is that even if they get what they want, it doesn't mean they don't AfD again right after they get approval.

      " A Chelsea-persona page sounds excellent but too much resistance: There has been too much arguing to reach a broad consensus for a better solution about Manning. Ideally, we could re-redirect \"\"Chelsea Manning\"\" to a new page \"\"Chelsea Manning (persona)\"\" to summarize all the massive coverage about Chelsea Manning, in the new persona, plus the history of the new name along with the months/years (\"\"Breanna\"\"?) which led to this notable new name, then include some background leading to the old spy persona, \"\"Bradley Manning\"\". A similar fork has been made with \"\"Audie Murphy\"\" as the page primarily about his military career, but then his major acting career is covered by \"\"Audie Murphy filmography\"\" even though he was far more famous as an actor for 21 years, with older films even shown on network television stations to millions of viewers who did not study World War II. In fact, I was stunned when I read the intro of page \"\"Audie Murphy\"\" and it failed to mention \"\"actor, songwriter\"\" in the first sentence (only in the infobox). Clearly, Manning will be remembered, far more years, as the transgender whistleblower/spy, because in recent years, \"\"whistleblowers are a dime a dozen\"\" even after leaking numerous secret documents. Perhaps many years from now, we will have automated subarticle wizard-bots which will follow obvious rules of notability (e.g., counting related news articles over years from 5,000 top newspapers) and then recommend creating a 2nd article in cases where a person has 2 major identities with vast sources about each, unable to provide NPOV-balanced text within just one page without seeming wp:UNDUE text, with the massive details about the newer persona. The \"\"transgender spy\"\" is a huge, huge storyline which will echo for years, much like a person who later became an actor, but under an alias name, as compared to the ordinary \"\"whistleblower who\"\" as just one of many. -  \"\n",

      "I have only just noticed that you are changing the names from common to scientific because you are starting to do the Australian snakes (all of which I am watching). You do have a good argument, although I do not fully agree. The problem is that you are not going about it the wrong way. Since it is policy, you should be first trying to change the policy before mass changes to the encyclopadia. The policies are there to create consistency. All you are doing now is making it more confusing. People expect to find the common names on Wikipedia, because that is the way it is done at the moment. Also, it seems you haven't read the Tree of Life guidelines properly. In it, it says that common names should be used where there are formal common names (such as birds) or there is a relatively unique common name. Otherwise use the scientific names. For example: White's Tree Frog is unique, and therefore the common name should be used. However, if you look at Litoria chloris, the common name cannot be used. Its common name, the Red-eyed Tree Frog has a disambigous page, explaining why that common cannot be used, and states that Red-eyed Tree Frog is not unique. \n",
      "The entire issue is trying to account for the most ammount of people. If someone wants information on a snake, writes its common name into the search box, and comes across an article with a strange latin name, they may be off-put and think they wrote the wrong name, and it redirected to the wrong place. Especially if the article did not have a photo. If a scientist wants to look at an article, and puts in the scientific name, and it is redirected to the common name, they will be aware of what the common name is. In fact, you will find that in most scientific papers, they will use the common name, stating the scientific name once in brackets so their is no ambiguity. A lot of articles use the scientific name because their is no common name. There is no other choice, and there is no problem with this. \n",
      "Please, bring this up on WP:TOL talk page before changing any more articles. You cannot create consistency yourself, and all you are doing is making it worse. If policy is changed other people can help, and it is possible to get all the articles changed. Policy needs to be followed, otherwise the encyclopaedia becomes a jamble. Thankyou.\n",

      "Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said \"\"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives.\"\" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  \n",

      "So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments.

I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return.

      "Review of 1984 version\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a copyrighted review or summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1984, the movie The Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins as Bligh and Mel Gibson as Christian was released. The movie is set during the trial of Lt. William Bligh upon arriving home after the mutiny had occurred. In this movie, the events of the voyage up to and after the mutiny are shown as a series of flashbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bligh is not so much portrayed as a cruel tyrant in this film, but rather as a traditional ship's captain - a man of his times. While some savage beatings were carried out under Bligh's watch in this film, it seems to be in this film no different than any other captain would have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crew is shown in a different light than in the previous two films. They are shown to be a much more \"\"rough and tumble\"\" group than the crews in the other films. Many of them are shown as typical sailors of the time. Their motivations in this film are not always as noble as in the other two films.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this film, Fletcher Christian is a more complex character. He is shown at first as a friend of Bligh. At first Bligh thinks so much of Christian that he asks the man to sail with him for a second time. However over the course of the film both men turn against each other. The feelings become much more acrimonius after the ship leaves Tahiti after Fletcher has been forced to leave his wife behind on Tahiti. In this film, she is more of a reason that Fletcher mutinied than in the previous two films. Afterwards, Fletcher is shown as feeling remorseful because of the mutiny. He tells another mutineer that he wished he had given Bligh some muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this film, the crew is shown as having more responsibility than they did in other films. This film does not so much hold Bligh as responsible - rather it is the desire of some of the crew to go back to Tahiti. However, it does make the fact that Bligh was going to try circumnavigation as one of the reasons that some of the crew decided to mutiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the 1935 film, this version also concentrates on the trials of Bligh and those who were forced into the launch with him. It is the only film to show that one man died because of an attack by the natives of an island where the launch stopped.  Once Bligh's launch reaches a Dutch colony, his part in the story comes to an end. It shows the later voyages of the Bounty as they go to Pitcairn Island. It then goes to Bligh's trial where he is subsequently acquitted by the Admirality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1984 film was probably one of the more historically accurate of the films dealing with the Bounty. It shows both Bligh and the crew as more products of their time than anything else. This film also suggests that the motives behind the mutiny might not have been as noble as suggested in the other films. It also portrays the natives mostly nude as they would have appeared at the time of The Bounty's visit to the island (the previous films couldn't portray this because of censorship and decency concerns).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the distinguished cast—including Daniel Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson in supporting roles and Laurence Olivier in a cameo appearance as Admiral Hood—the film had a tepid critical reception (the capsule review in Newsday read in its entirety as follows: \"\"Man the bilge pumps\"\") and was not a great commercial success. \"\n",

      "\"\"This is the truth believe it or not. The zionists gangs came to Palestine with a main task to accomplish: to evacuate the civilians houses and replace its inhabitants with jewish immigrants from europe and russia. And they did it the Machialivic way. Committing massacres to terrotrise and force palestinians to leave. Read more from unbiased resources on history for your convenience.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You seem to be forgetting the dozens of massacres committed against jews by palestinian arabs during the time that the British had control of palestine, from the early 19th century all the way up to the arab-israeli civil war. It is amazing that you anti-zionists can ever claim that 1: arabs were there first (lie: jews can be traced in the land back to 2000 B.C, with a civilization established around 1100 B.C, palestinians are just arabs who were dropped off by invading muslims in the mid 7th century A.D. Thats about 2500 years after the jews) and that the jews started killing palestinians for no reason (lie: during the civil war the massacres committed by jews were a response to both recent and continuing decades of violence and racism against jews. while Irgun and others who committed massacres were terrorists and shouldnt have killed civilians, they were provoked many times over by arabs.) Also, the Jews stopped deliberately targeting civilians half a century ago; Palestinians still do today.\"\n",

A week later, however, I think you can see what we are up against here in the 'Balkan' domain. AndreaFox entered a post at ANI which superficially looked genuine. You all supported him/her. With hindsight, it can be seen that the edit(s) entered that DIREKTOR and I opposed/rejected/reverted were appallingly POV and supported by a desperate scratching around for internet sources that, when found, ranged from the neo-fascist (Sunić/IHR) to the vaguely circumstantial (Meares the translator). I, personally, have no doubt that Tito was no angel - he was a flawed human being, just as we all are - but I will not stand idly by while POV monsters attempt to abuse our Wikipedia to \"\"fight the good fight\"\". That's why I was (unacceptably) angry a week ago, but I hope that the developments of the last week enable you all to see what we face here. I, speaking only for myself, think that the Tito article in question dwells way too much on the WWII period, with not enough on the major period that should be covered, namely his time as head of state.   \"\n",

Her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity, nudism/naturists and pedophilia.  Her words are strong, and certainly her POV.  There is no backing with any research to support her point.  The net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles.  I agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important.  But not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested, some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction.

The first Europeans to arrive were the Vikings, who settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows around 1000 AD, after which there was no further trans-Atlantic contact until John Cabot explored Canada's east coast for England in 1497, followed by French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1534. In the early 17th century, Samuel de Champlain founded the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal and Quebec City, from which the French colonists extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and the present-day Maritimes, while French fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana. Concurrently, the English established fishing outposts on Newfoundland and established the Thirteen Colonies to the south.\n",

Via the peace treaties that concluded these conflicts, Acadia and most of New France was ceeded to Britain, which then, through the 1763 Royal Proclamation, carved the Province of Quebec out of New France, annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia, and placed all the former French territories under common law; six years later, St. John's Island became a separate colony. By 1774, the Quebec Act reestablished civil law in Quebec and reaffirmed the right of its population to practice their Catholic faith, as well as expanding the province's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, all of which helped to fuel the American Revolution. From that conflict, some 50,000 persons loyal to the Crown fled to Canada, where new regions were created to accomodate them: New Brunswick was split from Nova Scotia, and Quebec was divided into Upper an\n",

And if you look at the talk page, my issue was with needing to add the creation time, I wasn't even thinking about Giano (had I known adding his name was such an issue, I would have left it off, had I known I was going to be accused of harassment, I would never have even thought of adding it). As for WP:V for making claims about people, I just find that seriously bizarre. You are saying Wikipedia logs are not reliable sources for what Wikipedia editors do? That's pretty ridiculous. The log information stating exactly that information is precisely what readers would have to have had to look at (if they knew how to do it) to even understand the article. Finally, as for not using self references, look at the article context. It was quite clearly nonsense not to refer to the fact that that article had only existed for a few hours. How can you not self reference in that situation? Or are you honestly saying that was not pertinent information, about a claim being made about an article having existed or not? The situation falls squarely between the radio host example and the Siegenthaler incident. Adding a self reference was the only way that paragraph could be written to make any sense.\n",

I am concerned that the different assumptions of these two groups may lead to unnecessary conflict, which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two.\n",
      "\n",
      " The article \"\"Islamic science\"\" seems to have been founded by advocates of a modern intellectual movement called \"\"Islamic science,\"\" which seeks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional Islamic religious norms. Thus the article defines \"\"Islamic science [as] science in the context of traditional religious ideas of Islam, including its ethics and philosophy. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist. This is not the same as science as conducted by Muslims in the secular context\"\" (my emphasis).\n",
      "\n",
      " Historians of science, on the other hand, find this definition excessively constraining, since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the Islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecessors. It really doesn't matter to historians of science whether the particular scientist was Muslim (e.g., al-Khwarizmi), Sabian (e.g., Thabit ibn Qurra), Christian (e.g., Hunain ibn Ishaq), or Jewish (e.g., Hasdai ibn Shaprut), whether he advocated strict adherence to Muslim traditions (e.g. al-Ghazzali) or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers (e.g. Averroës), or whether he worked in a religious or secular context. If he studied natural phenomena and worked within the Islamic world, his work fits the historians' broader definition of Islamic science.\n",

      "These contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more different ways:\n",

      " I am somewhat confused by your statement that Astynax continues to promote Landmark as a religion. First, the use of the word \"\"promote\"\" is almost exclusively used in what would be considered a \"\"positive\"\" sense, and Landmark among others does not think of itself as a religion, so that description isn't necessarily \"\"positive.\"\" Also, as I think can be seen, the Human potential movement which Landmark is generally a part of is counted as a new religious movement, whose name strongly implies \"\"religious\"\" nature but only implicitly, and in fact est is listed in the List of new religious movements I helped put together based on the articles contained in encyclopedic sources on NRMs I found. So there is in my eyes no real reason for really questioning est's inclusion as a NRM. In response to  if you have any sources available to help improve the article, or which might be useful in determining which article we should use as the primary article on this topic area, any input would be more than welcome. So far as I can tell, Landmark has pretty much said that they were initially using the est approach, although they have admitted to changing it subsequently (I'm not sure how much, or if they've ever specifically indicated in what ways). So it might be that something like Landmark Forum or some similar title might be the best main article for the topic of the seminars as a whole, with specific information on the various groups and companies related to it in articles on those topics. Maybe. This is a bit of an active controversy around here, and the topic area has recently been reviewed by ArbCom because of its contentiousness, but if you have any sources availableor other input which you think might be useful we would all welcome seeing them.   \"\n",

The same thing happened, when the Arab Muslims invaded the Levant, Mesopotamia and North Africa and intermingled with the local nations, e.g. Berbers, Jews, Arameans, Black people, Copts etc..

Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was \"\"betrayed\"\" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. \n",

The \"\"Kekule notation\"\" seems to be much more popular among chemists. It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and \"\"electron pushing\"\" much more straightforward. The circle notation only seems to be common for some organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and some aromatic ions such as the cyclopentadienyl anion and the tropylium cation.   \"\n",

      "I'm getting tired of having to scroll through several pages to get to the bottom, so I'm starting a new section.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take a step back.  This article is the \"\"Ten Commandments\"\".  That is the verses in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 that are universally called the Ten Commandments; the ones that are debated about being placed in public school; the ones that are talked about as the fundamental of morality.  It is not about the list in Exodus 34.  The article is not about the use of the words \"\"עשרת הדברות\"\" in the Bible; it is about a particular Bible list that is called The Ten Commandments.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an important point, except that I would go further.  This article is not about a particular Bible list.  This is article about a cultural artifact known as \"\"the Ten Commandments\"\" that is strongly influenced by the Bible.  Sections of the Bible have been translated, moved around, edited, cropped, etc., and then declared \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\".  I think that many people think of the 10C as something where you just open the Bible up and there they are.  That's just not the case.  The cultural concept of \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\" is significantly extra-bibical.  Haven't you ever seen that Late Show bit where Letternman takes someone's words and edits them to say something different from what they actually said?  You can't just say \"\"well, I've quoted the Bible, so it's a legitimate representation of the Bible.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You feel that this statement is not sourced.  Yet I am sure you agree that the number \"\"Ten\"\" in the title \"\"The TEN Commandments\"\" comes from the Hebrew phrase \"\"aseret had'varim\"\" even if you personally think that this was a mistake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, I remain unconvinced of this.  I have seen no convincing evidence that the Bible using the word \"\"ten\"\" and people referring to the \"\"ten\"\" commandments are causally connected.  I certainly am willing to accede that this may say more about my knowledge of Bible research rather than about the 10C.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not think there is a better way of telling the reader that the etymology of the title \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\" for the list in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 is from the Hebrew \"\"aseret had'varim\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "So there are two problems immediately apparent here.  First, you have no cite for the claim that this is the etymology.  Secondly, even if it were the etymology, that would be an issue completely separate from whether the Bible actually says that.  After all, the etymology of the term \"\"Uncle Tom\"\" goes back to a book by Stowe, even though the Uncle Tom character is not in fact an \"\"Uncle Tom\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Any reasonable person reading the text as it now is would conclude that the Bible, in the Ex 20 and De 5 passages, uses the term \"\"עשרת הדברות\"\".  I don't see why you insist on retaining this misrepresentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a notable issue because, as you mentioned, the Ten Commandments are widely represented as being fundamental to Western Civilization.  Besides the numerous other problems with that claim, the fact that much of the importance given to \"\"The\"\" Ten Commandments is extrabiblical opposes that view.  \n",

Among the women, beauty, aside from the fleeting, epidermal bloom of girlhood, was quite lacking.  In every face, there was something wrong  lips thick, mouth coarse, upper lip too long, cheek-bones too high, chin poorly formed, the bridge of the nose hollowed, the base of the nose tilted, or else the whole face prognathous.  There were so many sugar-loaf heads, moon-faces, slit mouths, lantern-jaws, and goose-bill noses that one might imagine a malicious jinn had amused himself by casting human beings in a set of skew-molds discarded by the Creator.\n",

Follow the red link it creates and on that new page add {{subst:afd2 | pg=PageName | text=Reason}}~~~~ where PageName is the name of the article (case sensitive) and Reason is your detailed reasoning why the article should be deleted. Finally, go to WP:AfD. There's a link marked \"\"Add a new entry\"\".
